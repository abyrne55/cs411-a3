# CS411 Project Assignment #3 

## Prototyping API Calls: 

For our technology stack our group decided to use node.js because this web server is a good application to develop 
framework and allows us to hit all of our objectives for our overall app. 

We also chose node.js, because not only is it on the "hot list" for jobs, but also, because our group wanted 
to learn node.js. At first our group went back and forth on the different programming languages/technology stacks. 
We were not sure if we wanted to use Python or Django, but as the weeks progressed, we came to a 
general consensus that we would use node.js because we wanted to challenge oursleves and develop new skills.
