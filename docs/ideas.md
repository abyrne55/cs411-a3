## Leafify
With the recent legalization of recreational cannabis (a.k.a. marijuana) and the opening of 8 dispensaries in Massachusetts, thousands of people will be consuming legal cannabis for the first time in 2019. Just like any other plant, there are numerous subspecies or “strains” of cannabis, and each strain can cause a different psychoactive effect on the consumer. This can make it difficult for cannabis consumers who want to listen to music during their session to build a playlist that complements and enhances the qualities of the strain they’re consuming. To solve this problem, our team is proposing **Leafify**, an app that utilizes cannabis strain data from [Leafly](https://www.leafly.com), “the world’s largest cannabis information resource,” to recommend the [Spotify](https://spotify.com) playlist that best fits the high the user is experiencing, while avoiding inappropriate music that would “harsh the user’s mellow.” Leafly makes strain qualities like “happy”, “euphoric”, “creative”, and “relaxing” available via their API, making it possible to cross-reference the qualities of a user-provided strain name with Spotify playlists that mention similar terms. When combined with a simple, intuitive UI and ads from GrubHub, we hope Leafify can become a profitable application that enhances the cannabis experience.

**APIs Used:** [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com), [Leafly](https://developer.leafly.com)

**Database Usage:** Will be used as a user info store and for API request caching, since Leafly imposes a 420 request/day limit.
