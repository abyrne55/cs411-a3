## Leafify
With the recent legalization of recreational cannabis (a.k.a. marijuana) and the opening of 8 dispensaries in Massachusetts, thousands of people will be consuming legal cannabis for the first time in 2019. Just like any other plant, there are numerous subspecies or “strains” of cannabis, and each strain can cause a different psychoactive effect on the consumer. This can make it difficult for cannabis consumers who want to listen to music during their session to build a playlist that complements and enhances the qualities of the strain they’re consuming. To solve this problem, our team is proposing **Leafify**, an app that utilizes cannabis strain data from [Leafly](https://www.leafly.com), “the world’s largest cannabis information resource,” to recommend the [Spotify](https://spotify.com) playlist that best fits the high the user is experiencing, while avoiding inappropriate music that would “harsh the user’s mellow.” Leafly makes strain qualities like “happy”, “euphoric”, “creative”, and “relaxing” available via their API, making it possible to cross-reference the qualities of a user-provided strain name with Spotify playlists that mention similar terms. When combined with a simple, intuitive UI and ads from GrubHub, we hope Leafify can become a profitable application that enhances the cannabis experience.

**APIs Used:** [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com), [Leafly](https://developer.leafly.com)

**Database Usage:** Will be used as a user info store and for API request caching, since Leafly imposes a 420 request/day limit.

## Play Day
Nowadays with your busy schedule it might be hard to find a new jammin playlist, or even prepare for what your day might look like. Don’t you just wish you could find that perfect song to pump you up for your big meeting, or the perfect playlist for when you go to the gym? Well, luckily for you, by using Google Calendar and Spotify, we have found a solution to your problem! Our hopes are to create an app Play Day, that will recognize key words like: “gym”, “‘meeting” and “date” to create an optimal playlist before your next scheduled task, by using Google Calendar’s API, and then by analyzing a given calendar day for events, Play Day will and create/find a playlist, using Spotify’s API,  to email you. Even if you have nothing to do, having a “lazy Sunday”, or just relaxing with friends, Play Day would be able to recognize  this and recommend soothing jazz or instrumental music to compliment your state of mind. 

**APIs Used:** [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com), [Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/calendar/)

**Database Usage:** Will be used as a user info store and to store anything we need to store from the google calendar.
