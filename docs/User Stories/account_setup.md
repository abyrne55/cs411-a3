# Account Setup
If this is my first time as a user, I will be greeted with a welcome message. I will then be asked to link my Spotify account. This allows me to access my own personal Spotify playlists as well as the appâ€™s recommendations. If I do not have a Spotify account, I will be recommend different genres and artists that I can explore without Spotify.
