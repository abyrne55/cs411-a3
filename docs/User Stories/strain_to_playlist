# Strain-to-playlist
As a user who is over 21, I would sit down to chill and enjoy my favorite marijuana strain that was acquired legally. As a logged in user with a fully set up account, I could enter the cannabis strain I am going to consume, and the app would recommend multiple Spotify playlists based on that strain and user preferences acquired when I setup my account. Upon seeing a playlist I like, I can click the "Open in Spotify" button to launch the Spotify app and begin listening.
